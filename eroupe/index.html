    <h1>Trip to Europe</h1>
    <p>I was lucky enough to visit Europe last year and wanted to share some of my experiences and photos</p>
    <p>Some of the countries I visited were:</p>

      <ul>
      	<li>United Kingdom</li>
      	<li>Italy</li>
        <li>Greece</li>
      	<li>France</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
    <p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!</p>
    <p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.</p>
